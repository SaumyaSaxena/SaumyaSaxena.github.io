Hello! I am a third year Ph.D. student at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and am advised by [Prof. Oliver Kroemer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/oliver-kroemer/).

My reserch interests lie in using differentiable control algorithms for learning robot control in sensory-deprived environments for achieving dynamic and contact-rich tasks.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/oliver-kroemer/)

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
