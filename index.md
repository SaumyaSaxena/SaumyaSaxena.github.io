## Biography
Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by [Prof. Oliver Kroemer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/oliver-kroemer/) and work in close collaboration with [Prof. Andrea Bajcsy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~abajcsy/).

<!-- My research lies at the intersection of robot learning, control, and perception, with a focus on leveraging semantic, structural, and algorithmic priors to develop generalizable and safe robot policies. I am particularly interested in leveraging large-scale foundation models for semantic scene understanding to perform interactive tasks such as embodied question answering and semantic constraint adherence in novel environments. My long-term goal is to develop robots that can operate safely in unstructured environments, perform complex dynamic and interactive tasks, and collaborate with humans in assistive and caregiving roles. -->

My research lies at the intersection of modern control theory, robot learning and multimodal foundation models for robotics, with a focus on developing generalist robotic agents capable of performing complex long-horizon dynamic and interactive tasks in unstructured environments. I am particularly interested in leveraging multimodal foundation models for semantic scene understanding to perform embodied tasks in novel environments as well for enabling robots to understand and adhere to semantic safety constraints in dynamic and interactive settings. My long-term goal is to build general-purpose robots capable of lifelong and reliable operations in open-world settings enabling safe collaboration with humans in assistive and caregiving roles.


<!-- such as identifying and adhering to semantic safety constraints. -->
 <!-- I am particularly interested in leveraging large-scale foundation models for semantic reasoning -- enabling robots to understand and adhere to safety constraints as well as for semantic scene understanding for embodied tasks in novel environments.  -->

 <!-- My work explores reachability-based methods for dynamic and interactive contac-rich manipulation tasks and embodied question answering using task and scene understanding.  -->

<!-- My research interests are broadly aligned towards leveraging semantic, structural and algorithmic priors for learning generalizable and safe robot policies.  -->

<!-- My current research focuses on leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of large scale foundation models towards enabling semantic safety and embodied question answering in unseen environments. 
My long-term goal lies in enabling robots to perform contact-rich dynamic and interactive tasks in the real world and equip robots with skills to work alongside humans in an assistive and caregiving role while ensuring implicit and explicit metrics of safety. -->

<!-- and learning stable compositional dynamic models and differentiable optimal skills that generalize to more complex environments and tasks.  -->
<!-- My long-term goal is to learn robot policies for assistive robotic systems in the real-world and equip robots with skills that demonstrate their ability to work alongside humans in an assistive and caregiving role. I believe that for real-world application of robotics in everyday tasks, it is imperative that we take inspiration from humans and develop systems and control methodologies that utilize robot full body dynamics and support from the environment while ensuring implicit metrics of safety. -->

In the summer of 2023, I was an intern at Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI) Germany, and had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Luigi Palmieri](https://palmieri.github.io/) and [Dr. Narunas Vaskevicius](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U3KSTwkAAAAJ&hl=en) on semantic scene understanding for vision-language navigation in indoor environments.

Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/) and [Dr. Matthew Travers](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/matthew-j-travers/) on developing a belief space planning framework for utilizing contacts to reduce uncertainty.
 <!-- by combining the exploration benefits of sampling-based methods and the exploitation benefits of optimization-based approaches. -->
